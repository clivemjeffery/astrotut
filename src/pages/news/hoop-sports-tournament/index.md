Norton Community Sports Centre hosted a quadruple hoop sports tournment for local primary schools. Netball and basketball each featured two tournaments for A and B teams.

Our teams represented the school with impecable sportpersonship, energy and enthusiasm. Well done to the Norton Ninjas and the Norton Berserkers in the two netball tourneys. Ninjas came 2nd in the A team tournament, just conceding the decisive net in the last minute. The Berserkers also came 2nd in the B tourney.
