Year 6 sent three teams to a sports tournament against seven other local schools.

The tournament took place, in chilly weather, at Malton Community Sports Centre.

Our boys and girls football teams, both achieved the best possible result - **first place overall** in their respective tournaments.

The mixed dodgeball team was nearly as successful, placing **joint second** with two other teams, all on 10 points. They lost only to St. Mary's who scored 15 points over the six matches played.

All our teams played with the determination, spirit and sporting values that we hold dear. To all who took part, well done!
